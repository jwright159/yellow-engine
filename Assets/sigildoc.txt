ok so reimplent them later but for puzzles and have each nation represent a different element so there's a progression

- Exchange
- Link
- Displacment

Spell Attributes:

Target provides form, element provides material/effects
2 forms, at target and on way to target
Everything is Unity's particle system

TODO:
	non-vel movement is jittery
	vel movement doesn't snap with ease in
	vel movement just doesn't work in general
	disabling the transformy stuff still makes it move bc its parented to the hand
