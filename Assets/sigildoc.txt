Targets:
- Touching
- Projecting
- Beaming
- Scanning (hitscan)
- Channelling
- Casting (self)
- Caching [time]

Spell Mods:
- Loop
- Trace ( =) -> ^ ^ ^ - _ _ _ X( ) {spell}
- Chain (lighting)
- Spread (shotgun)
- Regional (aoe) [area]
- Reflective (doesn't recast spell)
- Emissive (recasts NEW INSTANCES of spells) [deadzone (reflection point)]

Directions (also vector math):
- Surface normal
- Gravitational normal
- Spell normal

Elements: actually don't do this, just use mana
ok so reimplent them later but for puzzles and have each nation represent a different element so there's a progression
- Vis (stupidly inefficient)
- Ignis
- Potentia
- Spatium (local dimensions increase with power, can't use time bc need to look along time axis)
- Massa
- Anima (soul)

Spells:
- Exchange
- Link / Capture
- Displacment

Spell Attributes:
- Charge rate (at cost of efficiency)
- Release rate (the difference between a burn and an explosion)
- Speed (of target method)
- Amount (again of target method)

Retriggers: things that cast (not fire) spells when a thing happens, NOT MODS!
- Spell on spell collision

------------------------

Examples:
- Projecting Vis-Ignis Exchange (fireball)
- - it charges when you hold fire and shoots when you release. simple.
- Touching Vis-Anima Projecting Capture Link (Jay's main, projectile redirection)
- - ok so what happens is a hostile projectile is shot towards caster
- - caster fires touch link, which turns it friendly
- - projectile is held while fire is held, like when a projectile charges, except it doesn't charge
- - projectile launches when fire is unheld, like projectile
- - so touch link p much just catches proj and sets it to displacement's thing
- - !!! probably more fun if you have to throw it or hit it like a baseball or something idk
- - wait so the touch link is cast as charging, automatically fires when collided with
- - this firing doesn't launch the projectile bc its not displacement, but emissive starts displacement charging

Target provides form, element provides material/effects
2 forms, at target and on way to target
Everything is Unity's particle system

notes on the gun:
	non-vel movement is jittery
	vel movement doesn't snap with ease in
	vel movement just doesn't work in general
	disabling the transformy stuff still makes it move bc its parented to the hand
